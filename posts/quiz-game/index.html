At first, it looked overwhelming (so many API parameters and JSON fields), but step by step, I made it work.
I learned how to:

Fetch categories and questions dynamically from the API.
Parse tricky JSON fields like question, correct_answer, and incorrect_answers.
Add a timer with threads, so the quiz doesn’t freeze while waiting for input.
Use os._exit(0) at the end to cleanly exit the game when it’s done.

One issue I ran into was the countdown timer and user input clashing — if you didn’t type an answer, the quiz would skip ahead without giving you space to respond. I solved this with threading, running the timer in the background while still letting the player type."><meta name=author content="Abhijith R Pillai"><link rel=canonical href=https://abxijth.github.io/posts/quiz-game/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.8fe10233a706bc87f2e08b3cf97b8bd4c0a80f10675a143675d59212121037c0.css integrity="sha256-j+ECM6cGvIfy4Is8+XuL1MCoDxBnWhQ2ddWSEhIQN8A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://abxijth.github.io/icon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://abxijth.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://abxijth.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://abxijth.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://abxijth.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://abxijth.github.io/posts/quiz-game/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://abxijth.github.io/posts/quiz-game/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Abhijith R Pillai"><meta property="og:title" content="Building My First Quiz Game with an API"><meta property="og:description" content="As part of the AMFOSS Club Praveshan tasks, today I built a command-line quiz game powered by the Open Trivia Database API.
