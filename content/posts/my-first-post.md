This is my very first post on this site — and what better way to start than by writing about **how I created this blog itself**.

## Setting up Hugo  
I wanted a **minimal, fast, and open-source** way to build a personal website. That’s why I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) — a static site generator written in Go.  

Steps I followed:  
1. Installed Hugo on my Arch Linux system  
2. Created a new site with `hugo new site my-portfolio`  
3. Picked `PaperMod` theme that matched my style  
4. Added my first pages [About](/about),  [Socials](/socials)

## Hosting on GitHub Pages  
Instead of paid hosting, I decided to use **GitHub Pages**, since it’s free and works seamlessly with Hugo.
