Today I spent some time exploring **OverTheWire Bandit** as part of the **AMFOSS Club Praveshan tasks**. Honestly, it was a mix of frustration and excitement—trying to figure out tricky file locations, hidden names, and weird encodings really makes you feel like a hacker in training.  

I managed to complete a few levels and got better at navigating the Linux terminal. I found myself experimenting with commands like `grep` and `strings`, learning little tricks along the way. Taking screenshots of passwords helped me keep track, but the real win was figuring things out step by step.  

It’s amazing how a few simple commands can unlock so many challenges. I’m looking forward to continuing tomorrow and seeing how far I can push myself!
